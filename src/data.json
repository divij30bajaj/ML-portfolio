    "about": "Jack of all trades and master of ONE - that's how I would define myself! I am a Computer Science graduate student and an NLP researcher at Texas A&M University under Dr. Ruihong Huang. My interests mainly lie in applications of LLMs in production systems and black-box LLM Interpretability. I bring 2+ years of industry experience in building Machine Learning pipelines from my work as a Data Engineer at Wells Fargo. My technical proficiency spans several object-oriented programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and Groovy, along with ML frameworks like Apache Kafka, Git, Jenkins, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. <br><br>Having graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT BHU), one of India's top 10 engineering schools, I possess both the academic foundation and the practical experience to excel at any work that comes my way. I have received accolades from my previous employers for being a quick learner and a responsible employee who takes full ownership of his work.<br><br>While I am focused on mastering my knowledge about LLMs, but why Jack of all trades? I love exploring new areas and playing around with things I donâ€™t know yet. My experience in mobile app development, entrepreneurship and game development as hobby projects, make me an all-round player. Opportunities to build innovative and valuable products have never failed to excite me.",
